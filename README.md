Machine Learning Classification: Underfitting, Overfitting, and Bias-Variance Trade-Off
Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the concepts of underfitting, overfitting, and the bias-variance trade-off in machine learning classification problems. The project explores different classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, to evaluate their performance across varying complexities. It includes preprocessing steps such as SMOTE for handling class imbalance, feature selection using SelectKBest, and model evaluation using multiple metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and learning curve.

The core goal of the project is to:

Demonstrate underfitting and overfitting: By evaluating models with varying complexity, the repository illustrates how underfitting and overfitting affect model performance.
Explain the bias-variance trade-off: The relationship between model complexity and generalization ability is explored through various visualizations.
Provide hands-on experience with model evaluation: Visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and learning curves give insight into how different models behave under different conditions.
Key Concepts

1. Underfitting and Overfitting
Underfitting: A model is said to underfit when it is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This occurs when the model has high bias and low variance. As a result, underfitting leads to poor performance on both the training set and the test set. The model fails to capture important relationships and has limited predictive power.

Example: Logistic Regression (underfitting model in the project) is a relatively simple model that uses linear decision boundaries, which may not capture complex relationships in the data.

Overfitting: A model is said to overfit when it is too complex and learns the noise or outliers present in the training data. Overfitting happens when the model has low bias and high variance. This results in a high training accuracy but poor generalization to new, unseen data (test set).

Example: Decision Tree (overfitting model in the project) is highly flexible and can create complex decision boundaries, fitting the training data extremely well but not generalizing well to the test data unless properly constrained (e.g., with depth restrictions).

2. Bias-Variance Trade-Off
Bias is the error introduced by overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can lead to underfitting.
Variance is the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance can lead to overfitting.
The bias-variance trade-off involves finding the optimal balance between bias and variance:

High Bias → Underfitting: When a model is too simple and does not capture the data's underlying patterns.
High Variance → Overfitting: When a model is too complex and overfits the training data, failing to generalize well to new data.
Balance: A model that finds the right balance between bias and variance will generalize well, meaning it will perform well on both the training and test data.
The goal of the project is to explore and visualize this trade-off by adjusting model complexity and observing how performance changes on both training and test sets.

Dataset

Ensure that the dataset (dataset.csv) is placed in the correct location (data/ folder). This dataset is essential for model training and evaluation.

Code Explanation
1. Data Preprocessing
Loading the dataset: The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv().
Cleaning the dataset: Columns with all missing values are removed using dropna().
Feature and target separation: Features (X) are separated from the target variable (y).
Encoding categorical variables: Non-numeric columns are encoded into numeric form using LabelEncoder.
Feature scaling: Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features have equal importance in the model.
2. Handling Class Imbalance
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the dataset by oversampling the minority class in the training data.
3. Feature Selection
SelectKBest is used to select the top 10 features based on the ANOVA F-statistic, which measures the relationship between each feature and the target variable.
4. Modeling
Underfitting Model: Logistic Regression with high regularization demonstrates underfitting by being too simple.
Balanced Model: Random Forest is used with hyperparameter tuning (via RandomizedSearchCV) to achieve a balanced performance.
Overfitting Model: Decision Tree with no depth restriction demonstrates overfitting by learning the noise in the training data.
5. Model Evaluation
Accuracy: The accuracy on both training and test data is computed to evaluate how well the models generalize.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix for each model is plotted to visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
ROC Curve and AUC: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is computed to assess model performance.
Learning Curve: The learning curve for Random Forest is plotted to visualize how the model performs as more training data is provided.
Visualizations
1. Train vs Test Accuracy Graph
This graph compares the training and test accuracy for each model.
Underfitting: The Logistic Regression model shows low performance on both the training and test sets, indicating it is too simple to learn the data.
Balanced: The Random Forest model shows similar accuracy on both training and test sets, indicating it generalizes well.
Overfitting: The Decision Tree shows high training accuracy but poor test accuracy, indicating it is overfitting the training data.
2. Bias-Variance Trade-Off
The plot shows the error rates of the Decision Tree model as the tree depth increases.
Shallow Trees (High Bias, Low Variance): These models underfit the data and show high training and test error.
Deep Trees (Low Bias, High Variance): These models overfit the data and show low training error but high test error.
Optimal Depth: The plot illustrates the point where the tree depth balances bias and variance, minimizing the error on both the training and test sets.
3. Confusion Matrix
Each model's confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the classification performance. It shows how many instances were correctly and incorrectly predicted for each class.
A high number of false positives or false negatives indicates the model is not performing well.
4. ROC Curve and AUC
The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
AUC (Area Under the Curve) quantifies the model's ability to discriminate between classes. A higher AUC indicates better performance.
Random Guess: A diagonal line representing a model that predicts randomly, used as a baseline.
5. Learning Curve
This curve shows how the model's accuracy improves as more training data is used.
Underfitting: The model shows poor performance on both training and test sets, indicating it has not learned enough from the data.
Overfitting: The model shows high accuracy on training data but lower accuracy on test data, indicating it is overfitting.

Conclusion
By experimenting with different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree), this project demonstrates the importance of balancing bias and variance.

Underfitting is a result of high bias, where the model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data.
Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new data.
The bias-variance trade-off highlights the challenge of balancing model complexity for optimal generalization.
This repository provides valuable insights into model performance and guides you in selecting the appropriate model for your classification tasks.
